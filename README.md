# MyReads Project
This is the project in which i have created a App for a bookshelf. This bookshelf has three different shelf named as 'currently Reading', 'Want To Read', 'Read'. This app allows the user to search the book as well as to select the book they want and organize books accorind to them. This application is build by using React and provide an API server to run the app.

# How to run the App
- To run this App Clone the repository or Use my github link-https://github.com/Ipsa-Pradhan/MyReads_App
- Then go to the project directory and the run npm install.
- Then run npm start to start the project.
- The project will run on http://localhost:3000/
- To stop the server press CTRL+C.


node_module folder is not upload to the repository. This is done because the folder can be very heavy (several hundreds of Mb).
So, users want to run your project locally, they will have to run "npm i" before "ng serve".
